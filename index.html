  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a professor of economics and director of a research institute that specializes in <strong>East and Southeast Asia</strong>. I have typically worked with "traditional" resarch questions, especially how firms operate in countries characterized by weak institutions and strong relationships between business and politicians.</p>
  <p>However, as a result of my personal interest in how internet is influencing society, I recently set up a five-year research program that focuses on the role of <strong>social media</strong> in both business and politics in Asia.</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I'm from <strong>Varberg</strong>, a small city on the Swedish westcoast, but my work is based in Stockholm and my family lives in Hong Kong. I tend to spend most of my time in <strong>Hong Kong</strong> or traveling in the region for work.</p>
